    "Limitations of ER Diagrams:\n",
    "    1. Complexity: For large systems, ER diagrams can become overly complex and difficult to read, making it challenging to understand the relationships and data flow.\n",
    "    2. Static Representation: ER diagrams represent a static view of the database structure and do not account for dynamic behaviors, such as triggers or stored procedures.\n",
    "    3. Limited Expressiveness: ER diagrams may struggle to represent certain complex relationships or constraints, such as many-to-many relationships, effectively.\n",
    "    4. Maintenance Overhead: As the database evolves, ER diagrams must be updated, which can create maintenance overhead."

    "Problems Faced with ER Diagrams:\n",
    "    1. Miscommunication: Different stakeholders may interpret the diagram differently, leading to misunderstandings about the data model.\n",
    "    2. Scope Creep: As requirements change, the ER diagram may need significant revisions, leading to potential scope creep in the project.\n",
    "    3. Difficulty in Changes: Making changes to the ER diagram can be cumbersome, especially if the relationships and entities are tightly interwoven.\n",
    "    4. Tool Limitations: Depending on the tools used to create ER diagrams, there may be limitations in functionality, such as the inability to represent certain data types or relationships."

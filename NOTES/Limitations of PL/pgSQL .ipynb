    "    7. Complex Debugging: Debugging PL/pgSQL code can be challenging due to limited debugging tools and error messages.\n",
    "    8. Limited Cross-Database Functionality: PL/pgSQL is specific to PostgreSQL and lacks native support for cross-database operations or compatibility with other DBMSs.\n",
    "    9. Scalability Issues: PL/pgSQL may face scalability issues when handling very high transaction volumes or complex procedural logic."

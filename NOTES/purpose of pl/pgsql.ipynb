    "Purpose of PL/pgSQL in PostgreSQL\n",
    "    1. Procedural Logic: Allows embedding procedural logic (loops, conditionals) into SQL queries, enhancing functionality beyond standard SQL.\n",
    "    2. Complex Operations: Facilitates complex operations and calculations that cannot be easily expressed in pure SQL.\n",
    "    3. Error Handling: Provides mechanisms for error handling with exception blocks to manage runtime errors gracefully.\n",
    "    4. Modular Programming: Supports the creation of reusable code modules through functions and procedures, promoting code reuse and organization.\n",
    "    5. Integration with SQL: Seamlessly integrates with SQL queries, enabling dynamic SQL and complex data manipulation."
